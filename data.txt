LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides a modular and flexible architecture that allows developers to chain together different components, such as LLM wrappers, prompt templates, document loaders, and vector stores. This enables building complex applications like chatbots, summarization tools, and question-answering systems.

One of LangChain's core concepts is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG systems enhance the capabilities of LLMs by allowing them to retrieve information from an external knowledge base before generating a response. This helps overcome the LLM's inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge or inability to access specific private data. The process typically involves embedding documents into a vector space, storing them in a vector database, and then retrieving relevant documents based on a user's query. The retrieved documents are then provided as context to the LLM, which uses this context to formulate a more accurate and informed answer.

LangChain supports various LLM providers, including OpenAI, Hugging Face, Google, and others. It also integrates with numerous data sources and vector databases. The framework aims to abstract away much of the complexity involved in working directly with LLMs and their ecosystem, making it easier for developers to build powerful AI applications.
